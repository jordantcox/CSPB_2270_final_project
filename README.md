## Data Sructure Implemented
Binary Heap

## Overview and Data Structure Explanation
A Binary Heap (BH) can be through of as a combination between a priority queue and a binary tree.
In this implementatio of a BH, we are using artificial flight data. 

This flight data includes an airport, flight, arrival time, departure time, and energy used. 
In this hypothetical scenario, the airplanes are electrified such that during their residence 
time on ground they must charge similar to an electric car.

The BH will be used to predict the number of aiport chargers needed at a site by prioritizing 
the airplanes by arrival time, departure time, and if there are an insufficient number 
of chargers the code will add chargers and re-run the model to make sure all planes can depart 
on time.
